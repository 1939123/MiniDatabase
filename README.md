The aim of this app to open text file with a CSV and convert it contents into binary file.

## Your Task
Complete Java code to implement binary file from `source.csv` contents. The implementation of reading the csv file is already done for you. So your task is to create new file called `data.db` as binary file and write contents of `source.csv` as binary using following instructions: 

|   | Year | Industry aggregation | Industry code | Industry name | Value |
| ---- | --- | ------------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| type | `int` | `String`         | `String`      | `String`      | `double` |
| length |  |  10 | 8 | 50 |  |

Each string you should write fixed length string as stated above.
